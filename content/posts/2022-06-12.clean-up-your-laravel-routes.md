When you create a new Laravel project, there is 1 route in your `web.php`:

```php
// file: web.php
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});
```

So you might assume that this is the best way to do it, but that is not necessarily the case. 

## Replacing the closure with a controller method
A neater way would be to replace the closure with a controller method. The implication, in fact, is that it can then be cached. That is not possible with closures. It would look like this:

```php
// file: web.php

use App\Http\Controllers\HomeController;

Route::get('/', [HomeController::class, 'index']);
```

Of course, you then need the corresponding controller:

```php
// file: app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;

class HomeController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return view('welcome');
    }
}
```

## But that's a bit excessive for just a view, right?
While this may be able to be cached, it is a bit over the top. What if you have 3 pages on your website that are not part of your functionalities? They are just there for information and contain no logic.

Then it gets a little excessive:

```php
// file: web.php

use App\Http\Controllers\HomeController;

Route::get('/', [HomeController::class, 'index']);
Route::get('/about', [HomeController::class, 'about']);
Route::get('/contact', [HomeController::class, 'contact']);
```

```php
// file: app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;

class HomeController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return view('welcome');
    }

    public function about()
    {
        return view('about');
    }

    public function contact()
    {
        return view('contact');
    }
}
```

## Introducing... `Route::view`!
Fortunately, Laravel wouldn't be Laravel if there wasn't a neater way to solve this. This way is [simply described in the documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/routing#view-routes), yet it is often overlooked.

If your route only returns a view, you can describe that directly in your route file. This allows you to skip the controller. The first argument is the URI and the second argument is the view name.

```php
// file: web.php

Route::view('/', 'welcome');
```

If you need to, you can also add parameters to it as the third argument.

```php
// file: web.php

Route::view('/', 'welcome', ['name' => 'John']);
```

And that's all! No more closures and no more messy, redundant controller methods!

## Wait! So why is the default route not using `Route::view`?
There is a very simple reason for this: Taylor finds this easier when debugging. 👇

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s honestly because I often try to recreate bugs in a fresh app and I need a callback route to do that - otherwise I have to type one or change the default route to one to get started</p>&mdash; Taylor Otwell 🪐 (@taylorotwell) <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorotwell/status/1494731462276370434?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

There is, of course, nothing to argue with that.
